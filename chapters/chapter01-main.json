          "description": "A new threat looms over the Northern Sword Coast!  Whispers tell of a  **White Dragon** spotted patrolling the skies around **Icespire Peak** in the Sword Mountains. With local guards stretched thin preparing for the worst, several of the small settlements surrounding the Sword Mountains have put out the call for capable adventurers who might lend their aid relieving the tension that these Dragon-sightings have wrought.\n\nOne such settlement is **Leilon**, a small mining town sandwiched between coast and mountain, just north of the dreaded Mere of Dead Men - a convenient resting place for travellers making their way along the High Road from Waterdeep to Neverwinter. It is here that you were drawn by rumours of work to be had and wealth to be gained, and it is here that your adventure begins.",

          "description": "Each of you has your own reasons for coming to Leilon, but fate has decreed that you all arrive on the same day - the 2nd of Eleasis, 1481 DR.  A long string of gorgeous weather ends the morning you lay eyes on the small mining town, as cloudy skies give way to the biggest downpour of the last couple months.\n\nDespite your arrival being unannounced, you are treated as though expected.  Guards at the town entrances barely spare a glance before directing you to the town square to \u0022report in with the Captain\u0022.\n\nLeilon isn\u0027t much to look at - mostly a collection of stone cottages with thatched roofs surrounded by an earthen rampart and defended land-side by wooden palisades.  One feature that does immediately catch your attention is the tall stone tower which rises up from the middle of town, clearly far older than the structures you pass as you hastily make your way down the streets, eager to get out of the rain.\n\nUpon arriving at the town square, you notice a large tent has been set up.  A hastily-made wooden sign is hammered into the ground outside, upon which the word \u0022Registration\u0022 is painted in large letters.  Each of you assumes this is where you are meant to be.  The inside of the tent is bustling with activity, as several adventurers huddle in conversation, sheltered from the downpour by the temporary structure.\n\nNear the back of the tent is a large desk, behind which sits a middle-aged male Human dressed in fine armour.  The bags under his eyes and grizzly stubble on his face indicate his fatigue.  The sheathed longsword by his side and elegant quill in his hand suggest that this is the Captain you were meant to report to.  By his side, occasionally helping with this thing or that, is a young male Human squire.",

His piercing cat eyes are a sharp redish-orange. He wears a cloak of strange patterns, not of the local fashion at least with vibrant colors and shapes decorate the collar and cuffs. Looped over his shoulders is a carrying case containing a lute. On his back is a standard travellers backpack though a thick tome is careful strapped tightly on it. The book has wooden covers though bound to a spine made of a large bone. Though next in line, he hardly notices as he tries to take in all the sights around him. Obviously not from around here..._",

As you exit the small town square, you eyes are drawn to three shrines - one to Lathandar, one to Tymora, and a much more recently-constructed one to Tyr, planted firmly between them.\n\nLooking to the horizon, you see that the docks of Leilon aren\u0027t very large.  From this vantage point, you can see why - uneven shallows send up frequent rough waves near the shore, a hazard to any large ship carrying cargo.  To your right looms the central tower, and as you catch glimpses between the thatch-roof cottages, you notice that the ground surrounding it - and in fact, the structure itself - seems to be completely dry.  As you stand there, drenched yourselves, you take a moment to observe this phenomenon.  Sure enough, though rain is falling above the tower, it seems to vanish into thin air before ever reaching the ground.",

During the reconstruction, new taverns opened up in town.  So slowly but surely, the drinking space was shrunk to make room for more rooms.  And more rooms.  Until eventually there was no drinking space at all - instead, just a whole lot of rooms not particularly well planned-out.\u0022",

He offers to bring you back to the entrance, and along the way, you run into a similarly lost Govath, standing at a four-way crossing scratching his head.\n\nThe two of you give a quick wave to Lyla on your way out, and upon exiting The Sword of Leilon, you see Rowan leaning under an awning on the other side of the road, smoking a cigar.",

I\u0027m quite certain actually that if I were to tell you a tale in any modicum of detail you\u0027d find yourself face down on the table sleeping like a wee babe.  So I will keep it brief.  I\u0027ve spent my life forging weapons, and of that life have spent the last quarter century crafting this here war hammer _he says while touching the hilt of the hammer rising above his shoulder_ .  The magic of dwarves and elves has been placed upon this hammer that it might acquire the strength of a dragons breath.  This will be my legacy after I am gone.  _His eyes start to focus on something far away._  As it is, the dragon is what has brought me here to risk life and limb to finish this hammer, now that would be a story worth telling.  _Shaking his head and focusing back on the room Govath turns back to Storm and asks._  So what is it that brings a tabaxi to these parts of the world?\u0022",

By the first chorus, you notice that several individuals are tapping toe to floor or finger to mug along with the beat of the music.  Before too long, a small crowd has gathered around your table - some humming along with each repeat of the chorus, others grabbing partners and beginning to dance.  At the song\u0027s conclusion, the majority of the tavern lets out an enthusiastic applause - and standing on the table, you see above their heads a frustrated male Half-Elf in the corner of the tavern, no longer surrounded by singing patrons, and no longer playing his lute.  Several people drop pieces of copper into your open lute case - a total of 23, by the time the crowd thins.",

However Storm takes mental note of the Half-Elf sulking in his corner though has no sympathy for him. Once the crowd has settled back into the natural rhythm of the tavern, Storm puts down the Lute and turns his attention back his two companions.*\n\n\u0022Your friend Mara seems nice. But a strange name for the boy she keeps shouting for. This one thinks to name a boy Boy is fairly peculiar though perhaps a custom in your lands?\u0022\n\n*Turning back to Govath he continues the conversation...*\n\n\u0022This one is pleased you enjoyed the tune. Perhaps they will sing it in taverns along the coast in your honor one day. To answer your inquiry about me, I simply came for something different. I will not bore you with details tonight, but I do come from the jungles of Chult. I have just arrived to your Sword Coast today and this is my first upon this part of the realm. I grew up in Port Nyanzaru, and like our good guide Rowan, I too am I guide for the land there. Of course when not doing that, I perform as you have witnessed.\u0022\n\n*Storm reaches into his cloak and produces a large thick tome, with a wooden cover and a spine made of a thick large bone. The pages are of quality paper and quill and ink are fastened to the top.*\n\n\u0022In the jungles, I have discovered a rather enjoyable passion. I study and document bones.\u0022\n\n*He flips through several pages that depict drawings and notes on individual bones to full skeletal frames. From small rodents to large beasts.*\n\n\u0022I have come to this part of your world to see new and fantastic beasts, monstrosities and wonders. This one wishes to document them in this Tome of Bones. The White Dragon, though dangerous as Dragons are, has stolen this one\u0027s attention. Imagine the pile of bones there will be in the Dragon\u0027s feeding ground...in it\u0027s lair!\u0022\n\n*Storms eyes go wide with awe.*",

Making your way (with some difficulty) back to the entrance of The Sword, you settle up with Lyla (a mere 3sp each, with the adventurer discount) and head outside to meet your new companions.\n\nThe weather is fairer today, the clouds slowly spreading to allow bits of sun to come through.  It\u0027s a welcome change being able to see the coastal down in proper daylight.  The four of you take a moment to breath in the clear coastal air as you stand just outside The Sword\u0027s entrance.",

You see Captain Reynolds and Geoffrey pinning back the flap of the large tent, preparing to accept the day\u0027s wave of fresh adventurers.\n\nContinuing on past the southern gate (which is no gate at all, really, but an opening in the palisade which leads to the High Road and, eventually, to the Mere of Dead Men), you find that the town is quiet at this hour of the morning.  Few people roam the streets, though you catch glimpses of shopkeepers beginning their opening routines and an occasional carriage passes by.  Looking around, you could almost forget about the threat which currently looms over the land, if it weren\u0027t the reason you were here to begin with.\n\nIn time, you come upon the barracks.  It would appear you are the first adventurers to arrive - in fact, the large wooden board outside of the well-fortified stone building doesn\u0027t seem to have anything posted to it yet.  Inquiring with the two guards standing duty by the entrance, you are informed that the day\u0027s postings will be up momentarily, and that you are welcome to wait.\n\nJust as you settle in, you notice five figures approaching from the opposite direction you came from.  The woman in front is toying with a small flame in her hand.",

You hang a left down a wide road and enter what appears to be the town\u2019s main shopping strip - several stalls and buildings offering all manner of goods, from flowers to furniture.\n\nHere, activity is beginning to pick up.  As the various shops open up for the day, townsfolk begin flitting back and forth, in and out of buildings, carrying their baskets of goods.\n\nBefore long, you find Wynn\u2019s Wares, a fairly large building with its name emblazoned in old-fashioned script upon a hanging wooden sign outside the door.  Upon entering, you doubt for a moment that you\u2019ve found the right place - the shelves are so littered with random curiosities that it\u2019s hard to see the adventuring gear in-between.\n\nBehind the counter at the back is an elderly Elf, who appears to be tinkering with a wind-up toy carousel.  He sets it down as he hears the bell above the door ring upon your entry.",

Pleasant looking enough and certainly less troublesome looking than our Reaver friends.\u0022\n\n*Storm sets his Lute case down along with a now, bulging travellers backpack.*\n\n\u0022Wynn\u0027s Wares is also quite the establishment. You should have a look when we return, there is all sorts of strange things. I did manage to trade for a few necessities that I notice you all have.\u0022\n\n*He proceeds to outline the adventuring gear he purchased such as a bedroll, rations, hammer, rope...*\n\n\u0022I also found these interesting things which I traded some of my wares from Chult for. I figure if we are to seek the Gnome\u0027s aid with this Dragon, a gifts may go a long way.\u0022\n\n*Storm first pulls out a small wooden box carved with stars and other cosmic objects. He opens it to display a mechanical diorama. It is a model depicting Toril and the moon Selune orbiting around Sol. He winds it up and the diorama beings to move.*\n\n*Next to that he produces a small mechanical Spider. Winding-up the mechanism hidden on underside, he places it on the table and the Spider begins to crawl.*",
