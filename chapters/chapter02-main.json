          "description": "You leave Leilon by way of the eastern entrance.  Lesser-traveled than the north and south exits which connect to the High Road, little more than a trampled-down footpath exists outside this opening, and even this fades as you move further away from the town and into the open plains.\n\nThe Sword Mountains loom on the horizon, your destination somewhere along their southern edge.  The Gnomes of Gnomengarde are a secretive, reclusive people - few outsiders have ever visited the settlement, so few people know exactly where it is.  Thankfully, you have an accomplished ranger with you to track the settlement down - or so you hope.\n\nSpeaking of your ranger companion, as Leilon grows more distant behind you, a strange transformation overtakes him.  His body begins to change shape, extending, changing colour, facial features morphing from the Human you encountered into something...different.",

Setting the Lute down, he stands up tall and presents a exaggerated bow in his colorful cloak.*\n\n\u0022I am Storm of Fire of the Boundless Jungle clan! Born to the beautiful, Eclipse of the Moon of the Boundless Jungle clan!\u0022\n\n*After his showcase of an introduction, Storm begins to pace, straight back and hands clasped behind him.*\n\n\u0022Cain may know this having met Glittering Pond, but the Tabaxi are called by the circumstances in which they exist. They are named by events that mark their clan, the locations of which they live, and signs from the stars.\u0022\n\n*Suddenly, Storms\u0027 hands flourish outwards and little stars flourish around him. Illusions.*\n\n\u0022The Boundless Jungle clan lived deep within the jungles of Chult in the valley beneath the Peaks of Flame!\u0022 \n*Storm, flicks his wrists and the illusions become a small depiction of a mountain ridge piercing up from the jungle canopy.* \n\n\u0022It is said they prospered and thrived though the lands were harsh.\u0022 \n*Suddenly a strange creature, a bipedal reptile of sorts pops into existence, replacing the image of the mountain.* \n\n\u0022Though one day, an omen appeared to the clan in the form of smoke...\u0022\n*The mountain line appears again but this time a stream of smoke rises from it.* \n\n\u0022The Peaks of Flame grew angry and the clan was afraid. They looked to the stars for guidance and were shown catastrophe.\u0022\n*The illusion changes to an image of the mountain erupting, spewing fire.*\n\n\u0022And disaster struck. Though as hard as they tried, the Boundless Jungle clan did not make it out of that valley. They fled as fast as they could, deeper into the jungle, but the fire was faster.\u0022",

Unable to escape, Eclipse of the Moon gave birth to her child while the sky rained down fire and the world burned around her.\u0022\n*Storm forms an image of his Mother carrying a bundle. She has ashen grey fur just like him.*\n\n\u0022And this was the world in which I was born in. A Storm of Fire.\u0022\n\n*The illusions wink out of existence and Storm poses for a moment in deep thought.*\n\n\u0022My Mother made the long and dangerous journey to Port Nyanzaru far north from the valley. It was there that she raised me. She worked as a jungle guide for expeditions mostly since a highly experienced jungle Tabaxi was in high demand. My Mother was well liked, she taught me how to play my instruments and to track the jungles. She passed away when I was 14 years of age. Complications from the fire and birth had caught up to her. There were many at her funeral that day.\u0022\n\n*Storm pauses again to scoop up his Lute and sits down next to the fire. Playing a soft melody he continues...*\n\n\u0022I followed in my Mother\u0027s footsteps as a jungle guide and played the taverns for extra coin. I was successful at both and enjoyed it. My life has been good and I owe it all to Eclipse of the Moon. But the years spent in Port Nyanzaru and the Jungles have grown...dull. As the last remaining member of the Boundless Jungle clan, I have no ties to the jungle. And so I have travelled far to reach your shores, to see new places and document new bones.\u0022\n\n*He taps the Tome of Bones affixed to his bag.*\n\n\u0022Speaking of which...do please keep your bones from your meal.\u0022",

I live in a small settlement near Secomber, which for those who are new to this area, is east of Waterdeep ...\u0022, _and turning to Storm_, \u0022and borders near the south of The High Forest\u0022.\n\n_Continuing to address the group he says,_ \u0022I\u0027m not an adventurer by any means, though I\u0027ve had my share of travel. I work for a shipments branch of the kingdom, carting and shipping goods all over. Not very glorified work, but its a nice way to see new places and meet all sorts of people.\u0022\n\n_Shifting on his boulder, he pauses a beat to recount the story before continuing ..._\n\n\u0022That was, until a few days ago. I was contacted by a private party looking for someone to make a pickup and delivery back to Waterdeep. In hindsight, I guess I should have realized the sketchiness of it, but it was on official Waterdavian letterhead and well ... the pay was really good. You see, I\u0027ve been saving to retire from the travelling life to finally settle down, maybe start a business.\u0022",

All was going well as Waterdeep crested the horizon when I suddenly rolled over a rock causing one of the crates to come falling out. As I was moving to place it _back_ on the card, I noticed it was slightly opened and inside I saw *weapons*\u0022\n\n_He pauses for a moment to give the others time to react ... but then he remembers nobody is accustomed to the dryness of shipping laws._\n\n\u0022Uh, right. The problem is, the movement of weapons as cargo is strictly forbidden unless in specific circumstances such as times of war or disposal, and *never* without a whole damn battalion escorting it. I was one man, in a cart. These weapons were *stolen*, and I\u0027m the idiot who agreed to smuggle them into Waterdeep.\u0022",

It\u0027s not uncommon that passing patrols might inspect large cargo carts, and although that wasn\u0027t always the case, I wasn\u0027t going to take any chances. So I bolted and I have no idea what happened to those weapons.\u0022\n\n\u0022I ended up taking the long way around back to Waterdeep, not sure to do. I wasn\u0027t even sure who I was smuggling these goods for but before I could make a decision, they found me. At some point I was knocked out and when I came to, I was standing in some hall of what looked to be a Waterdavian noble. They kept asking me what had happened -- I tried telling them the truth -- they thought I stole the goods for myself. It was just a mess.\u0022\n\n\u0022I got the sense I wasn\u0027t going to be allowed to leave that place alive and, for the second time in a day, I bolted. I think I headbutted the guard next to me? I don\u0027t remember really, it was all a blur. But what I do remember is hearing the blast of something *magical* behind me and instinctively ducking, felt it pass just over my head as I ran. It hit the doorframe and ricocheted into the side of my head.\u0022\n\n\u0022From then, it was just survival. I ran, I hid in the slums for a day, I found this nasty old cloak I\u0027ve been sweating in and took a flyer looking for adventurers in Leilon. And that\u0027s where I met you all.\u0022",

The cool mountain breeze reminds you that if ever your travels take you higher up the mountains, you may want to invest in some warmer clothing.  Nonetheless, the clear day and your regular traveling clothes are enough to keep you comfortable as you set off further into the mountains.\n\nBefore long, the patches of grass you were still seeing from time to time disappear completely as you enter a valley, mountain on the left and rocky hills on the right.  The terrain becomes more and more difficult, and by late afternoon you enter an area where frequent rock slides have left the ground beneath your feet jagged.  To continue this way could easily add an extra half a day to your trip.\n\nLooking around, you notice to your left that a steep incline leads up about 18 feet to a narrow ridge, no more than 10 feet wide. The ridge seems to continue off into the distance, and may be a faster way of traversing this particular valley.",

Looking above, he sees an outcropping of rock in the distance which Govath seems to have missed when keeping an eye out.  Slowly descending from the platform above are two figures, vaguely humanoid in appearance, save for the large wings which carry them gently to your level, about 30 feet from the edge of the ridge on which the party now stands.  Each of them is singing one part of the beautiful harmony now very clearly heard all around you.\n\nRuggo notices his companions\u0027 eyes track the creatures descent, gaze fixed and unwavering.  Suddenly, Storm seems to come to himself, shaking his head for a moment and looking around as though he had forgotten where he was.  Both he and Ruggo realize the severity of their predicament when Cain and Govath each begin to walk slowly toward the edge of the ridge.",

With a grin, the Harpy descends upon its prey, dealing significant damage to the prone Govath below.  Storm manages to snap Cain out of his trance with some Bardic Inspiration and a quick claw attack, and Cain leaps down into the valley in pursuit of the first Harpy.  Landing gracefully, he uses his momentum to launch two strikes at the Harpy, leaving it bloodied.  One swift crossbow bolt from Ruggo\u0027s weapon puts the creature out of its misery.\n\nThe Harpy dead, Govath comes to his senses.  \u0022Ah Cain did you fall down here as well?\u0022 he quips, launching an arrow from his shortbow into the remaining Harpy\u0027s leg.  \u0022Haha, no, just came down to wake you up\u0022, Cain replies, giving a wave of gratitude to Ruggo above (which Storm misinterprets as being directed at him.\n\nThe remaining Harpy, no adventurers left in its thrall, makes a desperate attempt to pull Ruggo over the edge.  \u0022Oh no yeh don\u0027t, mangy bugger!\u0022 Ruggo yells, sidestepping its grasp.  It attempts to flee, but Storm and Ruggo are too quick for it.  \u0022Not so fast, yeh ugly mug\u0022, Ruggo mutters before launching one final bolt into the creatures chest.  It falls backward over the ridge, tumbling to the bottom of the valley and leaving the four adventurers alone but separated - Storm and Ruggo upon the ridge, and Cain and Govath in the valley below.",

Not only is is pouring rain, but the rocky earth here doesn\u0027t sustain much of an imprint to begin with.  In time, it occurs to him that these Gnomes are known for being reclusive and probably don\u0027t venture far from their settlement often, if at all.\n\nStorm manages to find enough footholds to get up to higher ground.  Peering ahead, he is unable to see any cave openings, but gets a better look at the stream, which seems to wind its way around a bend in the mountain on which he\u0027s currently perched.\n\nGovath wanders along the rock wall, tracing his fingers against it as he walks along, humming the Harpies\u0027 song from the day before.  After a while, he realizes he hasn\u0027t been paying much attention, but figures if there had been a cave, surely he would\u0027ve noticed it.\n\nCain keeps a sharp eye out for any danger and _does_ spot a couple of Harpies on a distant cliff.  Much to his relief, after a few moments they take off and fly in the opposite direction.",

You follow it for a couple of hours, coming across multiple areas where the flow joins other streams at various forks.  The shallow stream you were once following is more like a small river now, and as it bends deeper into the mountains, you begin to hear the sound of a waterfall echoing off the walls of stone.\n\nAlong the way, you stop to fill up your waterskins.\n\n**Each party member gets:** 1 Water",

Erosion from a tall waterfall in the distance has carved out a large natural concavity from which the river originates.  The roar of the waterfall creates a cloud of mist as it plunges into a large pool of water below, inside of which rise two small islands _covered_ in two-foot-tall mushrooms of red, green and purple.  Several small cave openings overlook the pool from rocky ledges twenty to thirty feet above.  What little sunlight is pushing through the clouds is blocked by the surrounding mountains (and thankfully, a good amount of the rain is too), but the giant mushrooms appear to cast a dim, bioluminescent glow, giving their surroundings an otherworldly aura.",

Ahead of you, across the pool and in front of the waterfall, appears to be some kind of rope bridge extending between two more ledges, each a little shorter than the first.  Partially accessible without crossing the pool is a fourth ledge, about the same height as the ones connected by the rope bridge. Finally, directly to your left you see another ledge - except this one has what appears to be a walkway hewn out of the rock, which provides an easy path up to the cave opening at the top.",

Like a conductor with his baton, Pog waves about his wand, maneuvering the hand over to the stone wall on the left.  The hand dips down into a barely-visible hole in the stone.\n\nPog closes his eyes for a moment, and his movements become much more subtle.  Suddenly, you hear a loud _CLUNK_, and the two rotating pillars of blades begin to slow their movement, until they become stationary.  A narrow gap between rows of blades seems wide enough to allow passage - so long as the individual is careful as they squeeze through.  Again, the room seems designed with Gnomes in mind, not Firbolgs.",

Before you is a large cavern, lit with hanging oil lanterns like the rest of Gnomengarde.  Strewn all about the place are bits of machinery - gears, levers, buttons, switches - and what appear to be partially-completed devices that you do not recognize.  Two large worktables are set up in the middle of the room, a plethora of strange tools blanketing both.  Seated at one is a male Gnome, balding with thick eyebrows and a grey beard.  At the other sits a female Gnome with wildly pink hair and a pair of spectacles on that makes her eyes look like they\u0027re different sizes.  As they see Cain crest the top of the stairs, the female one speaks.",

And if there\u0027s a place to rest in case we find ourselves here an extra day. \n\nSecond we should try to speak with the King\u0027s as Ruggo said. If we can definitely conclude that neither are the doppelganger, than we will have a good advantage. \n\nThird we should search Gnomengarde. Speak to all the locals we can find and while doing so try to find out about these missing brothers. If they are still here, or at least their remains, it may give us some clues.\u0022",

Kings Korboz and Gnerkli\u0027s chambers can be found by heading straight through here and hanging a right - though the door is locked, and only Their Highnesses have keys.  If you head down those stairs, to your right, you\u0027ll find our resting chambers - our off-duty folks will be relaxing there.  Joybell, Dimble, Panana, Uppendown and Tervaround are on kitchen tasks today, and can be found across the river, along with Ulla and Pog, who you no doubt have already crossed if you\u0027ve made your way here.  Facktor\u00E9...well...she\u0027s probably off messing with some dangerous device or another.  You may want to watch your step around her, she\u0027s a bit of a loose cannon.\u0022",

Walking the length of the workshop, you notice to your left a ten-foot-high ledge, atop which appears to be nothing but an ornate pedestal with some kind of tome sitting on it.\n\nContinuing on, you come to a large cavern with several alcoves hewn out of the wall, each fitted with multiple wooden cots.  Strewn about what appears to be the common space are the remains of several campfires, and along the wall you see stacks of books, games, toys, and a few instruments.  Upon your arrival you see eight Gnomes - four male, four female - scattered about the place.  Some are reading books on the various cots, others are engaging in curious games, and one is sitting upon a boulder playing an upbeat melody on a small flute.\n\nThe right wall of the cavern contains an opening out to a ledge, from which you can hear the waterfall a little quieter than elsewhere in Gnomengarde.  As you step into the cavern, several eyes turn toward you in surprise, and the flute player stops his song.",

Carefully making your way across, one-by-one, you quickly head into the cave ahead, where Ulla and Pog stand watch on the ledge above you.  You inquire politely how to get to the wine cellar, and they direct you that it is right behind you, and to your right.  You recall seeing a door in the direction they describe.\n\nHeading around the corner, you grab the heavy, thick wooden door by the handle and give it a push.  Inside, you see twelve forty-gallon barrels set into wide alcoves.  Each barrel is supported by a wooden brace.  The four barrels to your right all appear to be tapped.",

We can\u0027t melee them!\u0022 he shouts.\n\n\u0022Uh fellas, the reason this is the only room with a door, is \u0027cause IT\u0027S A BLOODY POSSESSED DOOR TOO!\u0022 Ruggo shouts.  He tries to dodge back, but the appendage takes a second swipe, this time catching Ruggo up in its sticky grasp.  Ruggo casts _Hunter\u0027s Mark_ on the barrel creature, when suddenly the ground beneath his feet becomes a pool of mud.\n\n\u0022What is wrong with these gnomes! Hang on Ruggo!\u0022 Govath looses an arrow towards to door, but it flies wide, hitting stone and sinking into the mud below.  He moves towards Cain, offering up his daggers.",

He manages to climb out, narrowing avoiding another grasping attack, and upon getting to his feet, disappears into thin air as Cain throws Govath\u0027s daggers at the barrel creature.\n\nGovath finishes the creature off with his rapier, realizing that their ranger companion has disappeared.  \u0022Did we just lose our ranger to the floor?\u0022\n\n\u0022The floor, the door...who knows anymore! But that door is the son of a whore!\u0022 quips Storm, casting another _Vicious Mockery_ on the surviving creature, dealing it some damage.\n\nThe creature peels itself off the _real_ door, falling into the mud and shifting its body into something less recognizable.  It tries to clamber forward, but finds itself stuck in the mud.  Seeing the opportunity, the party strikes fast and hard, Cain and Storm both delivering blows, with a reappearing Ruggo firing another bolt into the morphing flesh.\n\n\u0022It is good to see you didn\u0027t get sucked into the floor Ruggo, now let us end this thing!\u0022 Storm rallies, before getting snatched up in an adhesive tendril.  \u0022CAIN, HELP!\u0022\n\nCain, flipping his one free weapon to his main hand, drives it down into the creature, dealing the final blow.  It stops its writhing around and sinks deep into the mud. The party hesitates for a moment, waiting in case some other unpleasant surprise awaits them - but some time passes, and it seems that they are truly alone in the wine cellar at last.",

Ulla and Pog give you a nod as you pass, sipping on some sort of steaming drink that they\u0027ve acquired since you last went past.  You cross over the misty bridge, remembering to step delicately, and squeeze past the stationary blades.  As you enter Fibblestib and Dabbledob\u0027s workshop, the two Gnomes seem intensely engaged in their work - Fibblesib is carefully pouring liquids of different colours into a large flask, and Dabbledob has removed the scissors from her helmet-like device, and now appears to be replacing them with several small metal discs.\n\nContinuing straight forward, you come to an intersection of hallways.  Recalling that the inventors mentioned the Kings\u0027 chambers were on the right, you head around the corner, continuing past the door which leads to the pedestal and the book atop it, until you reach a door at the end of the hallway.  As you approach it, you hear shouting from within.",

You see, our entire village is saturated in magicks quite beyond our control - mostly to our benefit, I must make clear.  It is the magicks which sustain our sacred mushrooms, and the magicks we Gnomes have harnessed to master our own spells and enchantments.  However, every now and then, the casting of a spell can produce a surge in the current of magicks which flows all around, resulting in...unexpected and unpredictable occurrences.  Our sacred tome, _The Magicks of Gnomengarde_, teaches us much about the topic - you may wish to have a look while you visit with us, if one of you is curious and able to read the Gnomish language.\u0022",

Maybe a duplication of a caster has been recorded in it. But it sounds as though Ruggo caused a surge in the arcane when he casted his spell of detection causing a duplicate of himself to appear. And we may have interpreted its *leaving* as a form of retreat from being discovered. But now I think the surge simply dissipated mid-conversation.\u0022 \n\n*Storm laughs at the situation.*\n\n\u0022It\u0027s funny how it has played out. We were focused on the surge as the threat and because of it, stumbled on the real threat. We solved the real threat thinking it wasn\u0027t and now have discovered we have been chasing a red herring. But perhaps just for safe measures, we should still have Ruggo cast it upon the whole group.\u0022",

The remaining party members open the door leading to the ledge where _The Magicks of Gnomengarde_ is kept.\n\nYou notice immediately why the tome is kept up here.  The air flow atop this ledge seems to keep the mist, which pervades the majority of Gnomengarde\u0027s tunnels and caverns, at bay, helping to preserve the tome.  Indeed, it seems to have been excellently maintained, despite being centuries old.\n\nCain carefully picks up the old tome and begins reading it aloud.  The first half of the tome details the history of Gnomengarde, and speaks of the founding fathers\u0027 discovery of a wellspring of \u0022Wild Magicks\u0022 pocketed between the mountains.  This unpredictable arcane energy flows from somewhere underneath the mysterious mushrooms on the islands outside, imbuing the mushrooms themselves with properties that allow the Gnomes to sustain their entire society off them.  However, as King Gnerkli alluded to, it also comes with interesting side-effects - spells cast in Gnomengarde can cause surges in the Wild Magicks, leading to unpredictable results.  The tome only details a couple of examples - the caster\u0027s skin changing colour, a small tree sprouting nearby the caster - but it\u0027s clear that really, any number of things could happen.\n\nSkipping over some information about tending to and harvesting the mushrooms as well as a general ethical code, you come to the second half of the book, which outlines some common spells.  In particular, you find instructions on how to use the following: _Burning Hands, Detect Magic, Identify, Mage Armor, Magic Missile, Shield, Sleep._",

Shortly after you join Govath, Fibblestib and Dabbledob, the eight Gnomes you met in the resting area come piling in.  King Gnerkli arrives shortly after that, taking his place upon one of the two thrones atop the dais.\n\nAfter a few moments, the last of the residents of Gnomengarde join you.  Ulla and Pog, King Korboz, and five Gnomes you haven\u0027t met (3 female, 2 male) enter the throne room, King Korboz taking the second throne.  Once everyone has settled in, King Gnerkli raises his hands, which causes all of the Gnomes to fall silent.  He then begins to address them.",

We four have travelled here on behalf of the city of Leilon to speak about matters that threaten the Sword Coast. We have, however learned about the threat that tears apart your very home! We could not sit idly by and watch this magnificent place of magic and wonder fall into ruin by wretched beasts! With the assistance of some of your fine citizens, we have done a thorough investigation and have uncovered the hidden monstrosities that lurked in your caves!\n\nIt was truly a vicious battle. With massive *teeth* gnashing at our flesh deep in your wine cellar. Teeth like the razor sharp blades of your traps! And there was not one...but two! Oh it was a battle to behold, and we barely survived it ourselves. But rest assured, as your dear King Korboz and King Gnerkli have seen, the beasts are dead! And though we are wounded and exhausted, not one of us would say we wouldn\u0027t gladly have given our lives to save this treasured place.\n\nBut we are a thorough troupe of well-doers. We seek to restore peace of mind so that your children may rest to the soft sounds of your magnificent waterfall. So as your King\u0027s have said, we shall perform one more task to ensure all threats have been dealt with. And for this we shall need your full cooperation!\n\nThis fine Firbolg is the one known as Rowan the Gentle Guide of the High Forest. He will use his powers bestowed to him by nature to set all minds at ease. But we need your full cooperation! No matter what may appear or what you may see, do not be frightened. It is important that you let us investigate any odd occurrences that may happen.\n\nWe know you are brave people! A strong people! Stand together now for the good of Gnomegarde!\u0022",

          "description": "The four of you wander the tunnels and caverns of Gnomengarde, three of you crouched to avoid hitting your heads on anything.  Ruggo, using _Detect Magic_ as he walks along, senses a couple of magical presences as he passes by the door which you assume to be the treasury, as well as a couple as you walk up to the locked door of the Kings\u0027 chambers.  Other than those, he senses only the wild magic which pervades the entire village.\n\nAlong the way, the party discovers a handful of areas not explored during the day spent in Gnomengarde.  In a room down a hallway not far from where you encountered Facktor\u00E9, you discover two strange Gnomish contraptions.  Each resembles a crab with a barrel for a shell, six articulated metal legs, and a pair of forward-facing pincer claws.  Both are equipped with a hatch on top, currently open and revealing an interior compartment equipped with a small, leather-padded seat surrounded by levers, pedals and gears.\n\nBeyond the dining area which Storm had peeked into earlier, you find the door to the kitchen.  Inside, you see a hot iron stove, some sort of press-like contraption, a low table with a rolling pin on it, a counter with a couple lumps of some green substance on it, and a wide barrel with a large purple mushroom inside of it.  Suspended from the ceiling are several wide wooden boards, atop which are bottles and boxes of cooking ingredients.  These can be raised and lowered via a complex rope-and-pulley system the Gnomes seem to have set up here.  Additionally, large mushroom caps seem scattered all over the place, and Ruggo does sense that they seem to be imbued particularly strongly with the wild magic that saturates this place.",

She eyes you warily as you first approach, but when you express interest in the barrel crabs, her eyes light up and her guard falls.  Immediately, she launches into a lengthy explanation about the genius of her creations, explaining that they are used for tending to and harvesting the sacred mushrooms as well as construction tasks within the tunnels of Gnomengarde.  She is happy to answer all of your questions, and even allows you the opportunity to hop in one and drive it around for a short while.  It\u0027s a little cramped, but you manage alright, being fairly short in stature yourself.",

It appears that between working on her contraption and speaking with Govath, Facktor\u00E9 managed to cobble together four chairs of appropriate size, as well as a taller table, which the four of you sit down at.  Unfortunately your dishes and utensils are still Gnome-sized, but they\u0027ll do.\n\nZook plays his flute in the corner of the room, performing a duet with Nyx, who plays a beautiful fiddle.  The five Gnomes on kitchen duty fill your mugs with mushroom wine and bring out grilled red mushroom steaks and green loaves of bread, while the rest of the residents of Gnomengarde enjoy the feast alongside you at their chairs and tables.  Jabby and Delebean dance heartily near the musicians.",

Cain and Govath\u0027s skin goes pale, and your certain that Storm\u0027s would be too if you could see it beneath his fur.  Cain and Govath manage to keep it together, suppressing their gags, but within a moment of downing the mug, Storm vomits it back up - thankfully swift enough to bring the empty mug back to his mouth, first.\n\nThere\u0027s no hiding the sound of it, and the music stops, all eyes gravitating toward the party with looks of concern.  After an awkward pause, Zook lets out a mighty laugh, followed by Nyx.  Soon, the entire cavern erupts into laughter - not with mocking tone, just good, hearty laughter.\n\nOne of the dancing Gnomes comes by and gives Storm a sympathetic pat on the back.",

A moment of silence is given for Warryn and Orryn, the two Gnomes devoured by the shapeshifting mimics, and several citizens of Gnomengarde stand up from their seats in order to share a humorous anecdote or some pleasant words about their fallen brothers.  You sit politely and listen, until that portion of the evening passes, and King Gnerkli and King Korboz stand from their seats and turn to address the four of you.",

It was a good first adventure on the Sword Coast.\u0022\n\n*Storm slowly stands, staggering a bit and steadying himself on the wall.*\n\n\u0022Ugh...this is going to be a long day. If it is a bright sunny day outside then I think I will choose to join my clan in the after realms. Guide Ruggo, there are some things I want to do before we head out today. It should not take too long, but if the group can spare a few hours than it would be appreciated.\u0022\n\n*Grabbing his cloak and leaving the rest of his adventuring gear and Lute on his bedroll, Storm turns to head out.*\n\n\u0022I am off to see the inventors if anyone wishes to join me. Otherwise I shall meet you back here for departure.\u0022\n\n*Storm bows to the party and embarks with a slight stagger and the occasional pause to steady the dizziness.*",

He accompanies you to take care of disabling it so that the two of you can safely squeeze by.\n\nUpon entering the inventors\u0027 workshop, you find Fibblestib and Dabbledob both sleeping at a single worktable.  Dabbledob awakens suddenly at the sound of you entering.",

He then produces the mechanical spider and cosmic diorama which he purchased at Wynn\u0027s Wares back in Leilon, and asks if they might have anything similar available for trade.\n\nDabbledob takes particular interest in this, explaining that clockwork mechanisms are her \u0022thpecialty\u0022.  She seems especially taken with the mechanical spider - going over to her worktable, she pushes aside a bunch of scrap-metal and encloses a small object in her hands.  Upon her return, she unveils the object: a small clockwork bird, with a handle for winding up the complex mechanism partially visible through its exterior metal shell.  She winds it for you in demonstration, tossing it into the air, where its hinged wings flap, pulling it in small circles above her head until it gently descends back into her hand.  As it turns out, she makes these mechanical birds frequently and has a variety of shapes and sizes.  She\u0027d be willing to part with one in exchange for the spider.\n\nStorm goes on to inquire about the Nimblewrights, and the two Gnomes seem fascinated, but confess that they have no knowledge of such a device.  He doesn\u0027t get the impression that they would be much help with it, especially being unwilling to leave Gnomengarde, and so he decides to let the topic rest.\n\nFinally, he asks if they could use any further help with anything before the party leaves.  They thank him profusely for the offer, but insist that with King Korboz back in his right mind and the shapeshifter threat dealt with, Gnomengarde should be perfectly fine once again.",

There can be no doubting it now - you are looking at a White Dragon, its silhouette clear against the grey clouds rolling in, and it is heading in your direction.",

You dash in that direction as quickly as your legs will carry you, practically diving behind the bushes as you arrive.  Govath twists and lies down on the ground, clutching his warhammer in his fists tightly.\n\nA moment passes.  And then another.  Then, just as you feel the beast must have changed course and headed elsewhere, you hear the loud flapping noises of its wings, quietly at first, then louder, then louder still as it seems to descend upon your position.  Then, to your utter horror, you hear a loud thud atop the outcropping directly above you.  It shakes from the impact, loosing small rocks which pelt the four of you on their way to the ground.  You are painfully aware of the sound of a massive creature\u0027s slow breathing - which is bad enough, but far preferable to the sound you hear next.\n\nA loud crunch as teeth tear apart bone.  The sickening sound of flesh being ripped apart.  And the splattering noise of several drops of blood being flung from above, hitting the ground on the other side of the bushes.",

          "description": "Several agonizing moments pass as the creature above you devours its prey.  You watch as the clouds continue to roll in and the first drops of rain begin to fall.  Thunder rumbles somewhere in the distance, and shortly after, you hear the beating of wings.  A shadow is briefly cast over your hiding place as the Dragon\u0027s body soars over your heads, and the gust of air created by its takeoff causes something to fall to the ground below, just out of your sight behind the bushes.  You watch with bated breath as the great beast ascends to the south before making a wide arc east, wings fully spread.  Another moment passes before you dare move, but you hear nothing more now than the rain falling, getting heavier with each passing second.",

He stops suddenly at one point (cause you all to nearly tumble over him) to open a small door and grab a set of linens and a pillow, which he stacks in his arms and carries on.  Now, you\u0027re not even sure if he is able to see in front of him, yet he carries on as confidently as before, stopping once more to drop off the acquired items to a grateful female Half-Orc.

Its gigantic jaw hangs loose, revealing several rows of sharp teeth.",

Even Finneus respectfully stops playing, resting his lute upon his knee and listening to your performance.  You recognize the familiar faces of a handful of patrons which had enjoyed your performances the last time you were here, eager to see what you have in store for them tonight.\n\nYour performance doesn\u0027t elicit _quite_ the reaction you had hoped for, but it does seem well-enjoyed.  One silver piece and thirteen copper pieces are deposited in your lute case at the conclusion as you take your bow to a decent round of applause.\n\nMeanwhile, during your performance, the rest of the party notices as Syleen, Brakkis and Jabarl, three of the Stone-Cold Reavers, stand up from their table by the hearth and approach yours.  The remaining Reavers, who you recall are named Dobin and Runa, stay seated at their table.",

A place the locals do not like to talk about. a place they wish to keep quiet. Now as silly as this sounds and I\u0027m sure the locals wouldn\u0027t agree, but whispers suggest this place has something to do with the High Tower of Thalivar. Apparently no one has ever been inside of it and all sorts of tales exist of what it contains. \n\nIt would be unwise to assume any of these rumors are actually logical. If there was a way into the tower, surely it would have been discovered by now after all these years. I just think it would be fun to go see what the fuss is, get to know the town of Leilon a little more personally as it is my first experience on the Sword Coast.\n\nThe place is an alley known as the Manyclaws Alley. It can be a bit shady with thieves and the like so we should be on our guard. But there have been stories of strange noises, or mysterious creatures chasing people. Even of people disappearing completely without a trace.\u0022",

Continuing down the wet streets, the reflected glow of the various tall lanterns lighting your path creates an otherworldly display which you find mildly disorienting.  As you walk along the water\u0027s edge and hear the sound of the violent waves crashing against the distant rocks, you can\u0027t help but get the feeling that unseen eyes are watching you all the while.  You do get a glimpse of one or two shadowy figures standing about, often the pulsing glow of a cigar briefly illuminating their rough faces.  Govath recalls this area from a previous detour, but it\u0027s almost unrecognizable during the cloudy dark of night.\n\nAs you continue north, you gradually get the feeling that you are more and more alone, yet the thought grants you no comfort.  The lanterns thin, and eventually disappear altogether, as you reach an area of town where the houses have broken windows and doors, and no light emanates from within. \n With no stars or moon piercing the rainy clouds above, Cain and Ruggo are longer able to see ahead of them at all, and Storm and Govath can make out only grey shapes and shadows.  You are all suddenly very aware of the cold ocean breeze caressing your skin, giving rise to goosebumps all along your arms.",

Old, decrepit and spooky enough for a horror story. Every town and city has their scary folk tale and we, good friends, are standing in it. Every city or town has that one distinct landmark that people think about or see when they are here, you know...the tourist trap. Leilon has its Tower of Thalivar. But deeper down, there\u0027s also the hidden gems that only locals know about and that is much more exciting.\u0022\n\n*Storm peers into a broken window.*\n\n\u0022And now we keep an eye and ear out and discover what gems are hidden in these tales.\u0022",

          "description": "As the glow from your plank of wood illuminates the interior of one building and then another, you find that they appear to be abandoned houses.  What seems interesting is that the level of decay of the furniture and knick-knacks within seem to vary from house to house, and you get the impression that various people at various times have made attempts to live in this area, only to move on shortly afterward.\n\nA little further along, you come to a larger gap between houses.  Raising your makeshift torch, you peer forward and notice that this gap stretches for some distance - further than your light reaches.  Various half-rotten crates and barrels are haphazardly stacked at random intervals, and you see small alcoves and narrower offshoots created by more buildings further down.  The entire passage is pitch-black and far from inviting.  You\u0027re pretty sure you have stumbled upon the famed Manyclaws Alley at last.",

There, the Dwarf\u0027s legs still resting upon it, is a Human corpse, a horrific expression of terror frozen upon its lifeless face.",

Its skin is pale, and it seems to be wearing the tattered remains of some kind of sleeveless robe over its muscular frame.  You notice that both its shoulders seem striped with bad wounds - in fact, almost every area of skin you can make out seems to be marred in one way or another.  But none so horrifyingly as the face, the skin of which seems pulled unevenly tight over the skull by randomly-arranged hooks, resulting in a twisted, unnatural expression.  You see no eyes peering out from the shadowy sockets, yet the creature\u0027s head occasionally scans back and forth as it makes its way toward you.",
