You saddle your new horses, mount, and head west on the Triboar Trail toward the High Road.  Taking some time to judge the horses' pace, you figure you'll probably need to stop once along the way.  Thankfully, you recall that there's a small, recently-established mining settlement just off the trail: Phandalin.  You decide it would be sensible to try and make it there before finishing the day's travels.",

          "description": "As a man of trade, Cain has heard bits and pieces of Phandalin's history in his travels.  Some centuries ago, it was a highly prosperous town, owing its wealth to a mine somewhere in the Sword Mountains that was used to produce magical items.  Apparently, some dwarves, gnomes and human wizards had some kind of pact by which they worked the mine together and shared the profit.\n\nHowever, that all came to an end when a combination of several orc tribes came down from the Sword Mountains and laid waste to both the mine and the town.  For the last five hundred years, the mine has been lost and the town has been in ruins.  However, over the last few years some enterprising individuals have been working to make the town a bit of a trading hub between the miners working the Sword Mountains and the larger cities such as Neverwinter and Waterdeep.  The effort has been fairly successful, causing a small settlement to rise up around the business.

A few meager houses surround a couple of larger buildings along a main road heading south toward the Sword Mountains.  They look recently-constructed, but by no means extravagant.\n\nYou identify one of the larger buildings as the Stonehill Inn - a cozy establishment run by a human male named Toblen, who welcomes you and sets you each up with a meal, a bed, and feed for your horses for a modest three silver pieces each.  You enjoy an evening by the hearth, largely having the place to yourself, save for a couple of miners who stop in for a mug of ale.",

          "description": "You all scatter among the hills, guiding your horses into the wide valleys of dried grass in hopes of making it out of the dragon's sight.  It proves futile.  Govath watches in horror as the creature swoops down behind Spirit of the Wind and opens its mouth wide to unleash a torrent of frost toward him.\n\nStorm gives a powerful kick to both of Spirit of the Wind's sides, spurring him on as fast as he can go.  It proves just enough to stay ahead of the icy blast.  Govath feels the air turn cold against his face as he glances back to see the ground behind him turn to a solid sheet of ice.\n\nThe dragon's breath stops, and for a second Storm and Govath hope against all odds that the beast will be too lazy to continue the pursuit after failing to freeze its targets solid.  Unfortunately, with one mighty beat of its wings, it overtakes Spirit of the Wind and suddenly drops directly in front of him, with a mighty thud that sends grass and soil flying all around.  The horse rears back in fear and surprise, knocking Storm and Govath to the ground as Cryovain, no longer some distant threat, towers over them and lets out another mighty roar.",

Vanishing with his _Hidden Step_, Ruggo leaps off his horse and runs in the opposite direction.\n\nGovath and Storm scramble to their feet.  Storm attempts to cast _Suggestion_, but it has no effect.  Meanwhile, Govath quickly begins inserting a rag into a flask of oil, hoping that a fiery attack might deter the icy creature.\n\nCain swiftly turns his horse toward his companions, looking frantically for some sort of shelter.  _\\\"We should run for the mountains!\\\"_ he shouts, producing his signal whistle and attempting to distract the dragon.\n\nCryovain takes some swipes at Govath, but Storm's _Cutting Words_ take the edge off the attack.   Govath frantically launches his makeshift weapon, which misses the creature but still burns its feet as it explodes onto the dry grass just behind it.\n\nThe situation dire, Storm makes a last-ditch effort to end this conflict without any deaths.  _\\\"Fly high eastward to the depths of the High Forest. Take a peaceful nap at its heart,\\\"_ he shouts, casting _Suggestion_ again.\n\nCryovain pauses a moment, breathing heavily, staring at the feline form shouting at him.  After a tense, uncertain moment, he suddenly beats his powerful wings, launching into the air.  Letting out one final roar, he speeds off eastward, in the direction Storm's finger points.",

Much to your relief, the rest of your ride is fairly uneventful.\n\nYou turn off the Triboar Trail onto the High Road, heading south past several slower caravans making the usual deliveries between Neverwinter and Waterdeep.  Each of these seems to be surrounded by well-armed individuals, the threat of the dragon causing many businesses to hire mercenaries and adventurers to protect their goods, even along such a well-traveled road.  Even these hired protectors seem on edge, as you catch many of them scanning the sky at regular intervals for any signs of the dreaded beast.\n\nNight has fallen by the time you arrive back, and you find that the tent that had been set up in the town square has been taken down in your absence.  Presumably you will need to find Captain Reynolds in the morning in order to report on the fate of Butterskull Ranch and Tibor Wester's logging camp.",

Pushing past the door, you see that about half of the tables and chairs have been haphazardly shoved aside, creating a large open area where a crowd seems to have gathered.\n\n_\\\"Brick! Brick! Brick! Brick!\\\"_ they all seem to be chanting at the top of their lungs.  You hear the telltale thud of a fist slamming into a face, and the crowd erupts in cheers and shouts.\n\nGlancing around the tavern, you notice Mara standing by the bar, looking over at the commotion while impatiently tapping her foot, but she makes no move to intervene.  Boy is at her side, seemingly entranced by the nearest wall.  Looking over at the famous skull for which the place is named, you see that somebody has seen fit to dress a dead possum in a toddler's pink dress and hang it by its tail from one of the tusks.\n\nIn a corner table, away from the crowd, you can't help but notice the majority of the Stone-Cold Reavers nursing ales and taking little notice of the festivities.  Syleen balances a dagger on her finger, while Runa appears to be snapping the teeth out of a large, rat-shaped skull one by one.  With each crack, a disturbing smile creeps across her face.  Jabarl appears to be picking the remains of his dinner out of his teeth, and Dobin, face covered by his cloak as always, seems engaged in a book.  On the table between them sits a large piece of parchment that you recognize as a job posting, surrounded by mostly emptied plates and mugs.\n\nYou don't see Brakkis, the half-orc, sitting with them - but you do suddenly hear a member of the crowd yell _\\\"Punch \\'is dirty green skull in,\\\"_ which gives you a pretty good idea of where you could find him.",

It takes a moment for the suspicion of the surrounding folk to wear off, but eventually they look at each other and shrug, joining in the rhythm.\n\nThis spreads like a wave through the crowd, and soon the _thaumaturgy_ isn't even needed, because the whole tavern is shaking with every stomp.  It has the strange effect of heightening the sense of drama, as what was once a chaotic, dissonant aura of shouts now becomes focused, rhythmic beating.  All attention turns back to the ring, where the two fighters have momentarily paused at the strange phenomenon evolving around them.  Even the Reavers look up from what they're doing to see what's going on.  Syleen looks over at Storm atop the table and rolls her eyes, but with a slight smirk on her face.\n\nSuddenly, one brave spectator begins the chant you heard when you entered the tavern.  _\\\"Brick!  Brick!\\\"_ now in time with the music.  More and more voices join in, each more loud and confident.  Emboldened, the large human rushes toward Brakkis, landing three quick blows to his gut and face.  You can see that he is bloodied and bruised, but a renewed vigour seems to have taken hold of him.\n\nBrakkis attempts to retake ground by grappling the human in his large, muscular arms, and for a moment it looks like it's working.  The half-orc attempts to pull his opponent to the ground, but suddenly his footing slips.  Sensing the opportunity, the human lowers, and then flips Brakkis over his back in a mighty burst of strength.  Brakkis lands with a thud, and the human quickly drops on top of him, fists repeatedly flying into his face.",

As you pass the High Tower of Thalivar, you notice a small group of children throwing random objects at the invisible barrier, giggling with glee as they bounce harmlessly back.\n\nTurning the final corner toward the barracks, the street seems quieter than your last stop to Leilon. Something strange does catch your eye, however. Two figures emerge from the barracks - a male elf and a female human, you can just make out at this distance - wearing the finest clothes any of you have ever seen. Any of you except Cain, that is, who recognizes fine Waterdhavian fabrics when he sees them. The elf wears an extravagant but elegant outfit of green and gold, accented by a hood, boots and gloves of the finest brown leather. The woman wears a fine black tunic and pants, over which flows a silky cloak of deepest wine red. The pair look out of place in the streets of this small coastal town, so far from the noble courts where they no doubt belong.\n\nThe elf mutters something to the human before both don their hoods and begin walking down the street in your direction.",

          "description": "Geoffrey leads you down the hallway to the right, eventually turning into a room considerably more glamourous than the lobby.  Several banners emblazoned with various crests line the right wall between various well-kept swords, axes and lances.  The left wall is entirely comprised of bookshelves, carrying tomes large and small, old and new, colourful and bland.  A large stained-glass window is set into the back wall, depicting a fully armored knight atop his steed, sword raised high above his head.  The incoming light reflects off of two beautiful suits of armor on stands at the corners near the entrance.  In the room's centre is a large, beautiful desk of solid wood, most of its surface area covered by a large map of the Sword Coast covered in various markings.  Surrounding it are various pieces of parchment, multiple types of quill and a couple bottles of ink in different colours.  Seated at this desk, in a high-backed wooden chair lined with padding, is Captain Reynolds, who looks up at you all as you enter and smirks.",

From below them they came. Pincers slashing at anything that moved. Their heads skewered onto the mandibles of monsters!\"\n\n\"...we rescued him, shell shocked and terrified. His mind lost to the stench of death around him.... .... and off we sent him with a travelling merchant band bound for Neverwinter.\"\n\n\"...the orcs descended upon the ranch!

The farmhouse over run, the Ranch owner cried as he proposed we burn his home down and flush them out. But hope was not lost that day, not for us. We stormed the doors...\"\n\n\"...a quick stop in Phandalin, the first really night among civilization since leaving Leilon...\"\n\n\"...we raced ahead of the Dragon but it swooped down and cut off the pass ahead. We battled it; ice, teeth and all. We threw everything we had at it, everything we knew.\"\n\n\"...realizing the threat was not it, but us, the dragon fled East. But it will be back...\"",

With plans in motion to put an end to the dragon, our attention now turns to back-up plans and dealing with the aftermath.  Both of these will require retreading familiar ground for you lot.  There is an old fortress to the east, among the mountains, where the people of Leilon and Phandalin would need to take shelter if it should come to the worst.  It has been sealed for many years, but is both spacious and safe.  However, in my experience, no abandoned fortress stays empty for long.  We need it investigated and, if necessary, cleared out.\n\nOn the other hand, the various orcs driven from their home by the dragon have been cause for increasing concern.  We have reports from Neverwinter Wood of growing sightings - and more importantly, some seem to have fallen sway to spellcasters that dwell within the forest.  The last thing we need right now is an army of orcs at the beck and call of some evil cult.\n\nWe'd be grateful if you were to take on either of these jobs.  The details can be found posted in the usual place.\"",

They push it open and hear the usual chime of the bell, and are greeted on the other side by what sounds like quiet carnival music.  Looking to a nearby shelf, they spot the little toy carousel which Wynn was repairing during their first visit, now fully functional, spinning away and playing its song.\n\nThe old elf himself sits on his stool behind the counter, a magnifying glass to his eye, examining what appears to be a small glass sphere.  His raises his head as you enter, still absent-mindedly holding the magnifying glass to his face.",

You find that by using your thumb, you can cause the gear to grind against the flint, creating a spark which lights the small wick on fire.\n\nThe tiny flame doesn't produce much light, but you realize could be used to quickly and conveniently light other things on fire.\n\nA small piece of parchment tied to the device reads _5 gp_.",
