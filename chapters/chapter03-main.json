Thoughts of the Tower of Thalivar come to mind and last night's adventure. Storm realizes how much he enjoys lore and perhaps that's why this whole mystery intrigues him.*\n\n\"I am a Bard of Lore I guess.\" *he says, chuckling to himself*.\n\n*He lays there for a few more moments, slowly waking up with the feeling that there is somewhere he needs to be...\n\n...\n...\n...\n\nGiving a Tabaxi curse, Storm leaps out of bed and quickly dresses. He packs up his bag and equips all his gear before racing down the maze of hallways to the lobby fearing that he has held everyone up by sleeping in.*",

If you wish to wait, perhaps I can impart some information to you in the meantime.\n\nUnfortunately, several adventuring parties sent out on recent errands never returned to us.  Some, admittedly, perished at the pursuit of their tasks - a risk that everyone understood from the beginning.  Such is the nature of our work.  Many others, however, fell in a string of attacks by the Dragon itself.  It would seem that the time of sparse sightings and low whispers is past.  The creature has openly presented itself as a very real threat.\n\nThe Lances have sent inquiries out in every direction to better ascertain the nature of our adversary, and our contacts in the north have come through for us.  We know both name and nature of the beast - _Cryovain_, they call it.  A fairly young White Dragon originally spotted over the Sea of Moving Ice.  Something has driven it south after a what I'm told is a long period of remaining unseen.  Our scouts have confirmed it seems to have settled somewhere in the eastern peaks - much to the annoyance of the Orc tribes which are known to make their home there, I am sure. \n\nWhite Dragons are a primal and aggressive sort, I'm given to understand.  Little matters to them beyond kin, food, and hoard.  We can only assume this recent string of attacks are a display of dominance and a testing of power.  Leilon joins the other cities and towns of the Sword Coast in making preparations for the worst.  But our primary concern must be the safety of our own citizens, so we must rely now more than ever on the generosity of adventurers like yourselves to assist outside of the city walls where needed.  Unfortunately, more have fallen than have registered, these past few days.  And so we have doubled our usual rewards and are allowing each party to take on up to two tasks at a time, should they wish.\"",

Fortunately seeking shelter before it could spot us.  It was however devouring some possibly elf or human, we have a wrist band from them that perhaps you recognize.  We also saw it fly off in a North Eastern direction after finishing its meal.\"\n\n\"Now better news, we cleared the route to Gnomengarde of some harpies to better improve the safety of any future travel or trade with the gnomes.  We can describe how to find your way there to someone familiar with the area.  The gnomes were not particularly excited about us bargaining into their quaint domain, have a trigger happy gnome guarding entrance.\" _Govath rubs where he got shot in the shoulder._ \"They have agreed to aid Leilon and are currently working on developing an automated ballista which we be ready for pick up within the week.\"\n\n_Turning to the group._ \"Anything else I am missing?\"",

In doing so, we received this magically crafted item in return.\"\n\n*Storm takes off the hat and places it on the desk. He then explains the properties once a caster is attuned.*\n\n\"This hat may pose useful to one of your men in an attack or defense against Cryovain. However  if we continue further contracts for the Lances, it would also serve this group as well. The choice is yours Captain, this one is fine with either decision.\"\n\n\"To the point of Govath's report of Cryovain's sighting, our good guide Ruggo here can provide a detailed mark of where we encountered it in its possible hunting area.\"\n\n*Storm bows and motions for Ruggo to continue the report.*",

After making sure you're all aboard, he coaxes Winnifred forward, and you make your way to the northern entrance of town, passing through to the High Road.  The lovely weather and warmth of noon have you in excellent spirits as you pass by other travellers making their way between Neverwinter and Leilon with a smile and a wave.  It's not the fastest way to travel, but it's nice to be able to rest your legs for a change.  Govath keeps an eye out for the mysteriously-active lighthouse as you ride along, thankful for the clear day and the slight elevation of the High Road above the coastline.  Just as you pull off to the side of the road to break for dinner, its shape can be faintly made out to your west, a mere pinprick at this distance, but stark in contrast to the sea beyond.",

Though I do not doubt his heart or intentions. Maybe he is on the run from something like yourself. \n\nThose his connection with the Reavers is growing more apparent if he let slip that piece of info accidentally. Perhaps next time we seen them, which I do not wish for, we should indirectly ask them what they think of Firbolgs.\n\nI did notice his eye but didn't want to ask. He doesn't like to talk about himself so I figured maybe it was part of his human disguise though I did notice his Firbolg self still maintains it. \n\nEither way, he does good work and fights hard. This one does not worry of bad intentions from him. He does what he does and does it well. But thanks for letting us know, maybe we should see what else he lets slip.\"",

Have any of you in your travels?\" *He gives a gentle spin of the windmill blades, and it's clear by how they're weighted that they will continue spinning for a very long time unless purposely stopped.*\n\n*Placing it next to him to spin, he pulls out another very strange object. It's a construct of a bulbous, hideous looking creature. It has three arms and a large maw in the center facing upwards. Storm retrieves a copper piece from his pouch which looks like one of very few coins in there. He then places it on the indentations of one of the claws and you watch the contraption move and the beast \"eats\" the coin. The coin clanks into its body and settles with whatever else is inside.*\n\n\"It's some strange coin bank or something. Wynn hasn't figured out how to retrieve the coins so that's a copper piece this one won't be getting back any time soon. Have any of you seen a monster like this before?\"",

However, your hours pass without sighting or other incident.",

Search though you might, whatever path may have once connected the High Road to this lighthouse is long gone.  Winnifred and the wagon are both sturdy, however, so your progress is not dramatically slowed - and after about four hours of travel, you find yourself near the edge of a cliff which overlooks the beach below.  About two-hundred feet ahead of you, just above eye-level, you see a large outcropping of rock almost completely surrounded by water, atop which is a stone building from which the lighthouse tower rises.  You can faintly make out a narrow causeway connecting the outcropping and the beach, but it appears to be completely submerged in water at the moment, suggesting you have arrived at high tide.\n\nGlancing over the edge of the cliff to the beach below, something immediately catches your eye.  Pacing back and forth along the beach below is what appears to be a _massive_ crab, easily fifteen feet wide from claw to claw.  Casting your eyes a little south of your position, you do notice that a set of stairs has been hewn into the cliffside, leading down to the water's edge.",

But alas, it is probably best that I start from the beginning.\n\nYou see, my mistress, Miraal, took up residence in the lighthouse a couple of centuries ago.  As I understand it, she was a bit of a recluse, just looking for a place to live out her days undisturbed.  Except I suppose she got lonely, because about eighty years ago, she used her magic to grant me intelligence beyond my species, and we have been companions ever since.\n\nThat is, until a month or two ago, when a crazed Half-Orc burst through the doors of our quiet little home yelling about 'reclaiming the shrine of Talos' or some such thing.  My mistress bid me to flee, but stood her ground against the feral brute.  I managed to scramble my way out the door, but not before hearing a crack of thunder and a scream of agony - I knew in that instant that my one and only friendship had been brought to an abrupt end.\n\nI fled to a nearby cave, unsure of what future lay ahead of me.  For what purpose have I without my mistress?  What existence can there be for an unusually intelligent crab?  Alas, I was not alone with my thoughts for long, for much to my surprise, I saw Miraal crawling her way after me into the cave's entrance.  But not in body - no, indeed not.  Only her twisted, groaning spirit clawed its way into that dark recess that fateful night.  'Mistress', said I, with horror at the sight before me. 'Why are you not at peace?'\n\n'The conch!', she replied, with voice full of anger and anguish in equal measure.  'He has taken the _conch_!'\"",

          "description": "\"You see, Mistress Miraal was a practitioner of the arcane, and had a very special conch shell which she always had on hand when performing her magic.  I admit, such mysteries are beyond my understanding, but as near as I could comprehend her attempts to explain, the conch helped to _focus_ her arcane power. Never have I seen her treat another object with such reverence.\n\nTravellers, what followed was a fit of rage so terrifying that I am ashamed to admit I _fled_ from my lifelong companion, fearing for my own safety.  Yet I cannot bring myself to leave this place until I know that her spirit has been put to rest.  Many long days and nights have I watched and waited, hoping that someone might come along with the strength and ability to aid in retrieving the conch and returning it to Mistress Miraal.\n\nBut never fear - I understand that such services do not come for free, and thus the aforementioned compensation comes into play.  For you see, since the Half-Orc took possession of the tower, it has lit at every low tide, without fail - and somehow, it always seems to storm while the lighthouse is lit.  Several small ships have fallen victim to the false promise of safety, and I have carefully scouted each.  I say 'carefully', for you see, Daggermaw and her companions swim in those waters, and I would prefer my eventual demise not be between the teeth of a shark.  Each ship contains things which I believe travellers like yourselves would find valuable, and if you help me lay my mistress to rest, you have my word that I will brave the beasts to retrieve one of these treasures for you.\n\nNow, I know that is much to take in!  What say you, my new friends - will you help old Nigel out?\"",

Only vague memories are left but I do recall the pirates would pillaged and destroy as much as they could in their raids. And in return, Talos would bless them with the power to sink their enemies ships with power thunderstorms.

As the hours pass, the sky above grows even darker, and pretty soon the first rain begins to fall.  You do your best to stay dry under the shelter of the cliff, but as light rain turns to downpour you eventually accept your fate.  Despite the volume of water falling, however, you watch as the water begins to recede, and eventually you make out the causeway above it.  You make smalltalk and have some rations for lunch when you are startled by a sudden flash and crack of thunder as a bolt of lightning hits the lighthouse in the distance.  Almost immediately afterwards, it lights - and examining it much closer this time, you notice an eerie quality about it.  The glow is a greenish-yellow, and appears to intermittently weaken and strengthen in a regular, pulsing pattern.\n\nBy the time the tide reaches its lowest, a full-blown storm has brewed over the water to the west, and the sky is regularly filled with vibrant flashes.  As several gusts of strong wind blow inland, you can't help but think how grateful you are to not be at sea yourselves on an evening such as this.",

The ground beneath your feet is slick from the downpour and the earlier tide, so you find yourselves cautiously watching your step as you progress.  As you climb the stairs to where your path splits the smaller outcropping of rock, you notice that to your right is a small cavern opening, only a few feet wide.  The light emanating from the lighthouse does nothing to penetrate the shadowy interior, so all you can make out is darkness - but a chill runs down each of your spines as you approach, and you have a feeling it's not due to the ocean breeze.",

A spectral face turns toward you with furious anger in its eyes and tears running down its cheeks.  Its pointed ears, slightly visible through the hair, suggest Elf blood, but the face shape is unusual, and the webbed hands and feet unlike any Elves the four of you have ever encountered.\n\nThe figure's mouth moves in speech which you cannot hear due to the wax in your ears, and then, to your surprise, she drops to the ground and begins clawing her way toward you, each inch seeming to exert all of her strength to accomplish.  Her intangible robe and long hair drift behind her as though floating underwater, and you can clearly make out a hole directly through the middle of her chest.  Her mouth continues to move as she approaches, face twisted with hatred.",

Once she has finished speaking, her grip loosens, and she goes flying back into the back wall where she lets out a heart-wrenching screech before erupting into sobs and clasping her hair in her hands once more.  The screech is loud enough that even those wearing earplugs faintly make it out, briefly turning their attention to the entrance of the cave.",

          "description": "Ruggo fires his longbow, the arrow flying swiftly through the rain and knocking one of the harpies backward over the wall.  Govath follows suit, hitting the second harpy which takes off and begins flying toward the party.  Shortly after, five harpies, one wounded from Ruggo's shot, rise over the wall, and all six fly with haste to the straightaway.  Govath hides behind a spire of rock, taking potshots along with Ruggo, and several of the harpies suffers wounds before even making it to the party's position.  Lining each side of the causeway, they begin their luring song, but the adventurers' handmade ear plugs manage to block out the sound.  Storm casts _Bane_, catching one of the harpies, while Ruggo's _Hail of Thorns_ causes some damage to the three to the north.\n\nFrustrated by the party's immunity to their song, the harpies dive in, attempting to shove Cain, Ruggo and Storm off the causeway and into the water below.  Can dodges out of the way and Storm takes the blow and stays standing, but two of the harpies manage to pull Ruggo over.  He struggles to climb back up the slick rock, so Storm gives some inspiring words and Cain, after dealing some blows to a harpy, lends him a hand to get him back up.\n\nMeanwhile, a harpy spots Govath peeking out from behind the spire of rock, and swoops in to attack.  Govath repeatedly dodges out of the way, choosing to focus his shots on the harpies attacking his friends, which are going down one-by-one.  Unfortunately, his attacker finally lands a big strike, motivating him to disengage and run out to his companions.  The hungry harpy pursues its prey, landing another devastating blow and rendering Govath unconscious.\n\nRuggo uses _Hidden Step_ to move further up the causeway, reappearing at a distance to continue firing arrows at the remaining harpies.  One, heavily-wounded, attempts to escape back to its nest, but a quick shot from his bow puts an end to that.",

Being exceptionally careful not to slip, you begin your ascent as the wind howls and the rain swirls around you.  As the beam of light above you pulses, you now feel and hear a slight rumbling in the rock beneath your feet, almost like a heart's slow beating vibrating through the entire outcropping.  \n\nAs you crest the top of the stairs, you find yourself standing in a wide plateau, about eighty feet above the water below.  Before you stands the ominous lighthouse, a set of wooden doors with rusted hinges and handles providing the only visible entrance.  The walls are constructed from heavy stone, and the tower itself sprouts from the northwestern part of the building.  You have a brief scare as a bright flash of lightning strikes the southern part of the building, the crack of thunder nearly deafening you.  The sudden light reveals a thin metal rod rising up from the roof, extending nearly as tall as the lighthouse tower itself.",

It then turns its eyes to the sky and begins panning around, which you take as your cue to quickly duck behind cover again.",

Ruggo, suddenly encumbered with dead weight, tosses Cain over the wall with a mighty heave.  He lands with a thud in the courtyard.  Meanwhile, Storm attempts to cast _Suggestion_ on the matriarch, but even with insulting distractions, the creature resists the spell, charging him.  A few swift attacks with her ferocious claws, and Storm is unconscious, bleeding out on the ground.\n\nGovath snaps to, and seeing Ruggo struggle to climb the wall, offers him a boost.  On the other side, Cain also returns to reality, seeing his companion bleeding out near the matriarch protecting its young.  With incredible speed, he ducks under the creature's grasp, slinging Storm over his shoulder and rushes through the nearby door to the lighthouse building.\n\nRuggo and Govath silently argue for a few seconds over which of them should peek over the wall, with Ruggo finally conceding and noticing as he peers over the wall that their companions are no longer visible in the courtyard.  He hops back down, shaking his head toward Govath, while inside the lighthouse, Cain attempts to slap Storm back to consciousness with no success.  Before Cain can try any other method to save his dying companion, the Tabaxi stops breathing in his arms.",

He finds himself in a room where every stone wall is adorned with frescoes depicting ships being tossed about on stormy seas, with a dark and terrible figure wearing an eye-patch looming over them.  In the west wall is a salt-encrusted window, through which Cain can see by flash of lightning the mast of a ship rising from the water below.  Along the south wall sits a stone altar, lightning-shaped engravings along the sides and front.  A metal rod descends from the ceiling, splitting into two smaller cylinders which come down and touch the altar on either side of the top.",

As discovered earlier, there's not many places to hide, so you're satisfied as you scan back and forth and see nobody.  A sudden screech from beyond serves as a quick reminder of the dangers that lie in the courtyard across from you, but it doesn't appear the harpies have any interest in coming inside.\n\nAs Storm and Govath quietly push open the doors to the tower itself, they see a spiral staircase with an ornate stone railing.  From above, an eerie greenish-yellow glow pulses slowly.  To the north, a small wooden door leads to a room off of the tower.  From inside, you can very clearly hear loud snoring.",

It appears to be a simple living space - against the east wall is a bed, currently unoccupied, and againt the west alcove is a desk.  Against the south wall, however, is what you're looking for - there sits a large, barnacle-encrusted chair, looking as though it had just been pulled from the briny depths.  Sitting in the chair, head slumped forward, snoring, is a Half-Orc, bald with a short, grey beard.  He appears to be wearing armour crafted from octopus hide.  On his hands, currently resting on his lap, he wears gauntlets, each with two long, curved blades fastened to the knuckles.  In one of the gauntlets, held tightly, you see an opalescent conch, sparkling even in the dim light coming in from behind you.",

Cain, Storm and Govath all surround the chair before he can react, dealing their own blows - blows that easily should have killed him where he sat, but for some reason do not.  With each devastating blow, the party hears a loud _THUMP-THUMP_ from above, the glow coming through the door suddenly intense enough to flood the room with bright light.\n\nRuggo snatches the conch from the half-orc's hand, disappearing from sight and moving back toward the door.  \"It's time to leave!\" Storm shouts, dashing toward the lighthouse entrance, barely avoiding a swing of one bladed gauntlet.  Govath dashes too, instead choosing to run up the tower stairs toward the source of the eerie glow.\n\nThe half-orc stands from his seat, casting _thunderwave_ on Cain and then moving toward the door.  Ruggo tries to trip him, but he catches himself on the doorframe, and when he hears Govath heading upstairs, he dashes after him.  Ruggo, Cain and Storm all do their best to keep him from ascending, with Ruggo getting a good grip on him at last - but the half-orc calls upon the power of Talos, shooting a _lightning bolt_ from his fingers, knocking Ruggo unconscious and doing serious damage to Cain before continuing up the stairs.  Cain tries to grab hold of him once more, but without success.  Storm uses the last of his arcane energy to cast _cure wounds_ on Ruggo, saving his life.",

Thankfully, Cain tumbles beneath the half-orc's arms, shielding his eyes and swinging his shortsword blindly toward the heart.  It hits its mark, and suddenly the light fades.  Now able to look directly at it, Govath and Cain watch as the heart shrivels down to a normal size, then falls to the ground.\n\n\"NO!\" the half-orc shouts, clutching his chest and falling to his knees, eyes wide with shock.

The heart itself is wet and bloody, so you rummage around for something to wrap it in before storing it away.  Taking a closer look at the gauntlets, you notice that they aren't mere blades on the ends, but sharpened bone.  In fact, they appear to be fashioned out of wood to resemble a boar's head, with the extended sharpened bones as the tusks.\n\nOther than these interesting pieces of equipment, you do not find anything of value on the half-orc's body.",

Several fly into the matriarch, while other scattered projectiles pierce and awaken the young, who begin screeching and crying in pain. They scatter, moving as close to the walls as they can, several of them dragging wounded arms and legs along behind them. The matriarch takes a defensive stance and begins to look around in the direction that the arrows flew from, eyes settling on the top of the lighthouse tower.\n\nStorm takes the cue and immediately runs out, driving his rapier into the matriarch's body.  It does not hesitate, eyes flashing purple once more, attempting to paralyze its attackers.  Storm keeps his mind clear, but Govath and Cain fall victim once more within the building.  As Ruggo continues raining down arrows, Storm disengages and rushes inside, trying to shake his companions back to reality unsuccessfully.  The matriarch flies upward, beginning to sing its luring song, unaware that its attackers are wearing earplugs.  Storm takes the opportunity to run back out and cast _Suggestion_ on it.  \"Fly to the shipwrecks and bring back the most valuable object you can find as quickly as you can! Place it back here in this courtyard! Quickly now!\" he shouts, and the harpy matriarch complies, flying over the western wall and out of sight.\n\nStorm waves to the group and motions for them to take off their earplugs.",

Let me see, now...in my scouting I have seen the names of all five ships emblazoned upon their broken hulls, and I believe that within each may be an object of interest.  Three of the ships - the _Sea Urchin_, the _Compass Rose_ and the _Golden Gull_ - all contain chests which I have seen with my own eyes.  They're each fairly small, but some of the finest treasures are, too.  Upon the _Star-Crossed Lover_, I witnessed a fine-looking rapier clutched in a skeletal hand, untainted by weeks in the water.  And lastly, within the remains of the _Vainglory_, I saw a deceased figure wearing an elegant cloak, its vivid, unfaded colours creating stark contrast with the surrounding gloom of the wreckage.\n\nIn return for putting your lives on the line to bring my mistress peace, I will put mine on the line to retrieve the treasure of your choice.  Simply say the word, and I shall be off at once.\"",

Miraal cared very much about you and her departing wish was that you may find a new purpose now that she is gone. Do you have any desires or wishes you want to accomplish? \n\nPerhaps you can become the new warden of this Lighthouse, caring for the place you were born in a sense.  To be honest, it has crossed this one's thoughts to take over this lighthouse if it is possible. But if you wish to keep it, then it is all yours. \n\nOr perhaps you wish to see the world and experience adventure. You could join us. We are currently working out of Leilon on route to Neverwinter.\"",

Ruggo even manages to snag a couple of small woodland creatures - easy enough to store on the cart for the night's dinner.\n\nYou pass a handful of other travellers as you continue north, sharing smalltalk about the strange weather and the tension surrounding the ever-looming threat of a dragon attack.  Otherwise, your day is largely uneventful - you pass the Triboar Trail before dark of night, and find another spot along the High Road to set up camp.\n\n**Each party member gets:** 2 Rations, 3 Water (to a _max_ of 3)",

Speaking of the situation - as the four of you are walking, enjoying the weather and the scenery, you can't help but notice a winged silhouette enter your peripheral vision, far to the east.  Though it's nowhere close to the High Road, you watch it cautiously as it flies in a northwest direction, eventually disappearing out of your sight.",

The High Road splits here into two smaller roads, one which continues northwest and the other northeast.  A large wooden signpost is here, topped by a wooden shield with three snowflakes painted on it.

Hungry and tired, but in the final stretch at last, you pick up the pace - only to be brought to a pause shortly afterward by the sight of a chaotic scene outside the gate.\n\nDozens of torches light the scene, most held by armoured men and women who appear to be part of the city guard, but some by curious civilian onlookers. As you move in closer, you can see that a huge portion of the ground and wall outside the gate are covered in a thick layer of ice.  You see a pair of guards toss a large canvas sack over what appears to be a corpse, frozen in standing position. They then pick up the body and load it onto a wagon, on which you see a handful more canvas sacks.\n\nNear the scene, you see an overturned wagon, its contents strewn across the ground.  Several large stones surround it, at the end of shallow trenches of upturned dirt. Glancing up at the city wall as you move in closer, you notice several catapults lining the top, and ascertain that they are the likely source of the scattered ammunition.\n\nYou take all of this in as you slowly and cautiously draw nearer to the gate.  Just beside it, a crowd of civilians has gathered, and they seem to be asking questions of a heavily-armoured woman with greying hair, stern eyes, and several scars upon her weathered face.",

So I will recount the details but _one more time_, and then I must insist you all carry on and allow the Guard to finish our work.\n\nAbout mid-afternoon, a white dragon was spotted approaching Neverwinter from the southeast.  Our artillerists were quick to take up their stations in response to the report, and a barrage began as soon as the creature was in range. Unfortunately, a merchant caravan had just left the gate, and the beast pulling their wagon must have proven too tempting a morsel for the dragon to resist. Though they attempted to turn back upon hearing the creature's roar, they had no hope of outrunning the threat. It froze them in place, grabbed the beast of burden, and fled the catapults' attack, heading east. All of this information has been reported by several eye-witnesses among the guards stationed on the city wall. We have spent the evening ensuring we have all the facts, that we might continue to provide unmatched protection for the citizens of Neverwinter. Now that the ice has receded, immediate restoration measures have begun.\n\nNow then, if you'll excuse me...\"",

The walls and buildings seem to go on forever in every direction, and even at this late hour, several people are wandering to and fro through the well-lit, winding streets.  Ruggo takes the lead, guiding straight forward down a wide road toward what appears to be a _massive_ castle in the distance, surrounded by a high wall.  You can't help but notice that several of the towers seem to have collapsed and much of the structure looks in disrepair.\n\nAfter passing countless residences and businesses, you find yourselves approaching the Neverwinter River itself, wide and fast-flowing.  Ahead of you is a huge bridge connecting the south and north halves of the city.  Ruggo leads you in this direction, explaining that the Driftwood Tavern is located along the north side of the mouth of the river, in the quarter of the city known as the Blacklake District.  The bridge itself is wide enough for several carts to travel back-and-forth at once, and is lit by tall lanterns along both edges, casting light upon the various citizens who call Neverwinter their home.  You see people of every shape, size and colour here - Storm even notices a couple of Tabaxi as you reach the far side of the bridge, just outside the walls of the massive castle.",

          "description": "Not spotting anybody in his immediate surroundings, Cain guides the cart a little down the path behind the building as the rest of you venture inside.  Behind the tavern is a stable, well-populated with horses and other oxen, and lining a fence are several wagons and carts parked by other patrons.  A young stablehand takes notice of Cain and comes to help unyoke Winnifred, while informing him that the cost of lodging an animal is 'one dragon a night', settled upon the beast's retrieval.  Being familiar with many cities' currency names from his past occupation, Cain understands this to mean one gold piece.  With the matter settled, he heads inside to join the others.\n\nThe Driftwood Tavern is an interesting establishment.  The moment you each enter, you are taken back by the wide lobby, the walls of which are lined with statues, paintings and display-cases filled with pieces of Neverwinter's history.  Indeed, even as you pass this area into what appears to be the main hall (a room that could easily engulf both of Leilon's taverns at once), you notice that littered between the tables and chairs are many more artifacts - glass cases containing suits of armour, preserved documents, tools, instruments, crests and knickknacks.  Winding between all these obstacles are several individuals carrying food and drink to eager patrons seated at tables of all shapes and sizes.  You appear to have found some cross between a tavern and a museum.\n\nThough the place is much larger than The Orc's Tusks, it is far less crowded.  As you scan the room, you see that several tables are available, some near the multiple hearths that line the walls.  The occupants of the filled ones appear to be a mix of city guards and decently-dressed citizens.  On one end of the hall is a long bar, behind which you see a door that undoubtedly leads to the kitchen.  On the other end, a wide staircase rises to a second floor.  Soft music fills the building, though you see neither stage nor bard.",

The owner of this establishment, Madam Rosene, is passionately knowledgeable about our city's history, and has accumulated many artifacts over her years running this tavern.  I confess there is little I could tell you of any of it, for my family moved to Neverwinter only recently.  However, she is more than happy to answer any questions about any of the exhibits which may catch your eye, so long as you are a paying customer.\n\nSpeaking of which, the Driftwood offers a deal on food and board, if you're interested.  Our current dinner and breakfast specials, along with a room for the night, are provided, for the price of three dragons a person - and we throw in a glass of our very own Driftwood wine with the dinner, if it pleases you.  Tonight's special is a boar stew, served with bread and cheese, and tomorrow's breakfast is an egg, cheese and potato blend that I'm sure you'll find quite enjoyable.\"",

A handful of patrons approach Storm and grant him friendly compliments, simultaneously dropping coins into his lute case.  You all can't help but notice that it's silver pieces being dropped here, rather than the pocketful of copper Storm often received at The Orc's Tusks.  One group of city guards even stops by on their way out, dropping in a gold piece.  When all is said and done, the lute case contains one gold and thirteen silver pieces.\n\nMadame Rosene, who took in the performance leaning on the bar near the kenku statue, makes eye-contact and gives Storm a thumbs-up, before somehow reactivating the artifact's music, which once again fills the room as the four of you eat your dinner.",

          "description": "As the three of you peruse the various displays scattered throughout the tavern, you each find exhibits of particular interest.\n\nGovath finds an exhibit labelled 'The City of Skilled Hands', which talks about Neverwinter's reputation for cultivating some of the most skilled craftsmen and craftswomen in the Sword Coast.  In addition to the famous city gardens, which are in bloom all year round, Neverwinter's workers are famous for devising and crafting the catapults which line the city walls, intricate clockwork devices and beautiful, multi-coloured glass lanterns.  Scale models of the catapults, preserved diagrams and blueprints, and some examples of clockwork mechanisms and beautifully crafted glass fill display cases in one portion of the room.\n\nCain, on the other hand, finds himself viewing an exhibit of strange objects recovered and preserved from a cataclysmic, world-changing event known as the 'Spellplague', which occurred centuries ago.  Apparently, this was a decade of chaos, where magic ceased to work predictably and the very fabric of reality was altered as a result.  The display cases for this exhibit contain frozen blue flames, strange materials that can't quite be placed, and objects with symbols engraved on them from languages no scholar or spell has ever managed to translate.  A piece of parchment fixed to the wall explains that very little is known for sure about this short period of history, but many theories have been proposed.",

These apparently belonged to a group of wizards known collectively as the 'Many-Starred Cloak', who held the majority of political power prior to the Spellplague.  Apparently, the exhibit claims, the wizards and their tower headquarters, known as 'Cloak Tower', completely disappeared from the city during the Spellplague.  Six months after its conclusion, the tower itself suddenly reappeared, but all that remained of the wizards were these cloaks.\n\nAs Ruggo peruses the few patrons remaining in the tavern, nothing of particular interest catches his eye.  The number continues to thin as time moves well into the night, some moving upstairs to their rooms, others leaving through the front door, presumably to head to their homes.",

It takes no time at all for you to drift into a deep sleep.",
